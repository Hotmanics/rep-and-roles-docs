# Reputation

Reputation is a way to track trust between entities (persons, businesses, organizations). One key advantage is that it helps you to gain a baseline level of trust
when meeting someone new.

Represented as ERC1155 tokens

For example, if Bob (Entity 1) completes a project or attends an event for the DAO (Entity 2), then the DAO will have some socially accepted mechanism in place
to distribute Reputation to Bob. Thus, the tokens show up on public profiles like OpenSea where others can view online in an open and decentralized way.
