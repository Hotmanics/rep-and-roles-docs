# Reputation

Reputation is a way to track trust between entities (persons, businesses, organizations). 

Represented as ERC1155 tokens with configurable types based on the specific implementation's requirements.

The types currently include: Transferable, Soulbound, and Redeemable.

## Transferable

ABLE to be traded freely between entities, bought/sold through Decentralized/Centralized Exchanges, staked, etc; exactly like your usual ERC20 or ERC1155 token.

## Soulbound

NOT ABLE to be traded by any means, and is meant to be used as a representation of one entity's longstanding Reputation with another entity.

## Redeemable

ABLE to be traded ONLY to addresses which hold the BURNER_ROLE. This token type is meant to reward contributors with discounts, vouchers, event tickets, etc.
