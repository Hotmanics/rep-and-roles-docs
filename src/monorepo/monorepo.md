## Starter Kit

An all-in-one repository used to build, test, deploy and interact with Reputation & Roles smart contracts!

Forked from Buidl Guidl's [Scaffold Eth 2](https://scaffoldeth.io/), A modern Dapp framework with NextJS, RainbowKit, Wagmi and Typescript. Which supports Hardhat and Foundry.

### Foundry
The Foundry package makes use of Foundry, a toolkit for developing smart contracts, to develop, test, and deploy Reputation & Hats smart contracts. 

### NextJS
The NextJS package makes use of a NextJS project, which contains everything needed for a functional and hostable website that interacts with deployed instances of Reputation & Hats smart contracts.
